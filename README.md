   - Ensure you're on TestNet

2. **Get TestNet ALGOs**
   - Visit [Algorand TestNet Dispenser](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/dispenser)
   - Fund your wallet with test ALGOs

3. **Connect to Application**
   - Click "Connect Wallet" in the application
   - Approve the connection in your wallet

## üì± Usage

### Creating QR Codes

1. **Connect Wallet**: Ensure your Algorand wallet is connected
2. **Navigate to Generate**: Go to the "Generate QR" page
3. **Fill Details**: 
   - Enter a label (required)
   - Add description (optional)
   - Set expiry date (optional)
   - Choose notification preferences
4. **Generate**: Click "Generate QR Code"
5. **Blockchain Storage**: The QR metadata is stored on Algorand blockchain
6. **Download**: Save the QR code image for use

### Scanning QR Codes

1. **Navigate to Scan**: Go to the "Scan QR" page
2. **Choose Method**:
   - **Camera**: Click "Start Camera" to use device camera
   - **Upload**: Click "Upload Image" to scan from file
   - **Drag & Drop**: Drag image file onto the scan area
3. **Verification**: The system automatically verifies against blockchain
4. **Results**: View verification status and blockchain details

### Viewing History

1. **Navigate to History**: Go to the "History" page
2. **Filter Options**: Filter by type, status, or date range
3. **Transaction Details**: View blockchain transaction IDs and timestamps
4. **Export**: Download transaction history (coming soon)

## üîß Configuration

### Algorand Network Configuration

The application is configured for Algorand TestNet by default. To modify:

```typescript
// src/services/algorand.ts
const ALGORAND_CONFIG = {
  server: 'https://testnet-api.algonode.cloud',
  port: '',
  token: '',
  network: 'testnet' // or 'mainnet'
};
```

### Smart Contract Deployment

Smart contracts are automatically deployed when first needed. The App ID is stored locally for subsequent use.

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Generate a QR code with the application
2. Scan the generated QR code
3. Verify the blockchain transaction details match
4. Test expiry functionality with past dates
5. Test with invalid QR codes

### Blockchain Testing
- All transactions are on TestNet
- Use TestNet ALGOs (free from dispenser)
- Monitor transactions on [AlgoExplorer TestNet](https://testnet.algoexplorer.io/)

## üîí Security Considerations

### Blockchain Security
- All QR metadata is immutably stored on Algorand
- Smart contracts prevent unauthorized modifications
- Cryptographic signatures ensure authenticity

### Application Security
- Wallet private keys never leave the user's device
- All blockchain interactions are signed locally
- No sensitive data stored in application state

### Best Practices
- Always verify QR codes before trusting content
- Check expiry dates on time-sensitive QR codes
- Monitor blockchain transactions for your account

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Netlify/Vercel
The application is a static React app and can be deployed to any static hosting service.

### Environment Variables
No environment variables required - all configuration is in the code.

## üÜò Support

### Common Issues

**Wallet Connection Issues**
- Ensure you're using a supported wallet (Pera Wallet recommended)
- Check that you're on the correct network (TestNet)
- Try refreshing the page and reconnecting

**QR Generation Fails**
- Verify wallet is connected and has sufficient ALGO balance
- Check network connectivity to Algorand
- Ensure all required fields are filled

**Verification Fails**
- Confirm the QR code was generated by this application
- Check if the QR code has expired
- Verify network connection to Algorand

### Getting Help
- Check the browser console for error messages
- Verify your wallet has TestNet ALGOs
- Ensure you're connected to the correct Algorand network

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
